# MobileNetV2-Powered-Automated-Defect-Detection-for-Industrial-Equipment
This project uses MobileNetV2 transfer learning to detect defects in industrial equipment images. By addressing class imbalance with data augmentation and class weights, the model achieves 83.3% accuracy in binary classification of defective vs. non-defective items, demonstrating effective industrial defect detection.
